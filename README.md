**Goal:** Generate highly non‑classical quantum states of light by applying Gaussian operations to enhance the Kerr interaction.  
**Motivation:**  
- Linear optics + nonlinear Kerr optics ⇒ universal quantum computation  
- Challenge: Intrinsic Kerr nonlinearity is weak and optical losses are significant  
- Approach: Use inverse design to optimize Gaussian squeezing and displacement parameters to amplify effective nonlinearity
